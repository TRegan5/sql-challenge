# Module 9 sql-challenge

### Data Modeling

I inspected the provided CSV files and created a schema and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram using QuickDBD; link to schema and ERD: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/D8IgWK. 

Schema screenshot (employee_ERD.png) stored in the associated images folder. 

### Data Engineering

I exported the created schema to PostgreSQL (schema.sql) and imported each of the provided CSV files, first with tables containing no foreign keys and then those that did to ensure clean data and intact table connections. 

### Data Analysis

All data analysis challenges completed and stored in employee_queries.sql.
